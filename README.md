# Mihon-Backup-Maker
Convert Ani and Mal into a tachibk for mihon.
The converter will ask for you ani or mal list. 3rd party list makers should work as well.
Mal for sure works ani has only been made with a 3rd party fetcher.
ONLY WORKS THROUGH MIHON.
Komikku and probably SY dont have the exact same tachi formating and it wont work.
If you use those just import to mihon and export a new save.

Merger is exactly as it says. Take 2 MIHON saves and merge them.
The converter makes a mihon save so it will work with merger as well.


This was made by ai. Why becuase im fucin stupid thats why.
